About
------
pyRSSDownloader in an application (or script) which will keep track of and allow you do download items from RSS Feed.
It is licensed under GPL v2. A copy of the license is included in this repository (see files: LICENSE and COPYING).

Requirements
-------------
IT IS IN A VERY EARLY DEV STAGE SO DON'T USE IF YOU ARE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THAT KNOWLEDGE.
I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE DONE BY THE CODE. READ THE SOURCE YOURSELF BEFORE EXECUTING TO VERIFY IT IS COMPATIBLE WITH YOUR EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT.
I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPROPER OR ILLEGAL USE CODE THIS CODE. IT IS PROVIDED FOR LEGAL USAGE ONLY.

To run it requires at least one plugin, which will not be commited to the repository for the time being.
It is possible to create you own plugin, but it is a bit complex and I am not able to create documentation right now. Eventually...*
For the most part - for now - the code is just good for referencing/forking.
Only the SQLite driver is commited for the time being. MySQL to come, and perhaps others.
Autodownloader to come with many features(in background, perhaps it will optionally be able to run as daemon/service backend).

It is currently Installer-less.

The following software must be installed for the program to work:
-Python (http://python.org) (Tested with 2.7 x86 and x64 builds)
-pyqt4 (http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download - Be sure it corresponds to the python build you have installed)

Run
----
Add a plugin to the plugins folder.
Run pyRSSDownloader.py (rename to .pyw to hide the console window)

TODO
-----
-Fix GUI crashes (need to move gui exectuation to main thread)
-Cleanup, streamline and optimize the code a whole lot
-Implement settings save/load for all settings (not just db)
-Proper error-handling/logging
-Commenting
-Unit Testing
-Plugins (and samples)
-Autodownloader (includes many many per feed settings and features - some implemented or added by plugins)
